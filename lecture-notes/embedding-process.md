### Steps to Generate a Text Embedding
**Tokenization**: The first step is to break the text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters. For example, the sentence "I love programming" can be tokenized into ["I", "love", "programming"].

**Mapping Tokens to Indices**: Each token is then mapped to a unique integer index using a predefined vocabulary. Suppose our vocabulary is:

After tokenization, each token (word, subword, or character) is mapped to a unique integer index using a predefined vocabulary. This vocabulary is essentially a dictionary where each token in the corpus has a corresponding index.

Example:
Let's say we have a sentence: "I love programming."

Vocabulary:

{
  "I": 1,
  "love": 2,
  "programming": 3,
  "<UNK>": 0  // For unknown tokens
}
Here, each word is assigned a unique integer index:

"I" -> 1

"love" -> 2

"programming" -> 3

If the sentence contained a word not in the vocabulary, it would be mapped to the special token <UNK> (unknown).

Token to Index Mapping:

Sentence: ["I", "love", "programming"]

Indices: [1, 2, 3]

This mapping process converts the text into a format that can be processed by the embedding layer.

{ "I": 1, "love": 2, "programming": 3 }
The tokens ["I", "love", "programming"] will be converted to [1, 2, 3].

**Embedding Layer**: The indices are fed into an embedding layer, which is a part of a neural network. This layer transforms the indices into dense vectors. The embedding layer contains a weight matrix that is learned during training. Each row of the matrix corresponds to a vector for a specific token in the vocabulary.

The embedding layer is a crucial component of the neural network. It takes the integer indices from the previous step and transforms them into dense vectors of fixed size. This layer contains a weight matrix where each row corresponds to an embedding vector for a specific token in the vocabulary.

Example:
Let's assume our embedding dimension is 3, meaning each token will be represented by a vector of length 3.

Embedding Matrix (initialized randomly or pretrained):

[
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],  // Embedding for <UNK>
  [0.1, 0.3, 0.5],  // Embedding for "I"
  [0.4, 0.6, 0.8],  // Embedding for "love"
  [0.2, 0.7, 0.9]   // Embedding for "programming"
]

In this matrix:

Row 0 corresponds to the embedding for <UNK>.

Row 1 corresponds to the embedding for "I" ([0.1, 0.3, 0.5]).

Row 2 corresponds to the embedding for "love" ([0.4, 0.6, 0.8]).

Row 3 corresponds to the embedding for "programming" ([0.2, 0.7, 0.9]).

Embedding Lookup: Using the indices [1, 2, 3] from step 2, we look up the corresponding vectors in the embedding matrix:

"I" -> [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]

"love" -> [0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

"programming" -> [0.2, 0.7, 0.9]

So, for the sentence "I love programming," we get the following embeddings:

[
  [0.1, 0.3, 0.5],
  [0.4, 0.6, 0.8],
  [0.2, 0.7, 0.9]
]

**Generating the Embedding**: The tokens' indices are used to look up their corresponding vectors in the embedding matrix. For the sentence "I love programming", the embeddings are:

[
  [0.1, 0.3, 0.5],
  [0.4, 0.6, 0.8],
  [0.2, 0.7, 0.9]
]

**Combining Embeddings**: Depending on the task, you might combine these vectors into a single representation. Common methods include *averaging, summing*, or using more complex neural network architectures like *recurrent or transformer networks*. For simplicity, for this usecase let's average the vectors:

Average Vector = [(0.1 + 0.4 + 0.2)/3, (0.3 + 0.6 + 0.7)/3, (0.5 + 0.8 + 0.9)/3]
               = [0.233, 0.533, 0.733]
