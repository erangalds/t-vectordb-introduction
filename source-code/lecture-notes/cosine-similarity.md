Understanding the Dot Product and Similarity
The dot product of two vectors measures how much they "point" in the same direction. When two vectors are more aligned or similar in direction, their dot product is higher. Conversely, when the vectors are less aligned or orthogonal (perpendicular), their dot product is lower or zero. If they are pointing in opposite directions, the dot product can even be negative.

Mathematical Insight
For vectors 
𝑎
 and 
𝑏
, the dot product is:

𝑎
⋅
𝑏
=
∥
𝑎
∥
∥
𝑏
∥
cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
Here:

∥
𝑎
∥
 and 
∥
𝑏
∥
 are the magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors.

cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
 is the cosine of the angle 
𝜃
 between them.

If 
𝑎
 and 
𝑏
 point in the same direction (
𝜃
=
0
), 
cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
=
1
, making the dot product 
∥
𝑎
∥
∥
𝑏
∥
. If they are orthogonal (
𝜃
=
9
0
∘
), 
cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
=
0
, and the dot product is zero.

Example
Consider two vectors representing two documents:

𝑑

=
[

𝑑

Analysis
The dot product of 
𝑑
1
 and 
𝑑
2
 is 28, which is quite high. This high value indicates that 
𝑑
1
 and 
𝑑
2
 are very similar and point in nearly the same direction.

The dot product of 
𝑑
1
 and 
𝑑
3
 is -2, which is low and even negative. This low value indicates that 
𝑑
1
 and 
𝑑
3
 are quite dissimilar and may even point in opposite directions.

Application in Vector Search
In vector search, we use the dot product (or cosine similarity) to determine the relevance of documents or items relative to a query vector. A higher dot product indicates that the documents or items are more similar to the query, making them more relevant.

By ranking items based on the dot product with the query vector, we can efficiently retrieve the most relevant information, enhancing search accuracy and user experience.
