# Vectors
Vector embeddings play a crucial role in AI applications like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agents, natural language processing (NLP), semantic search, and image search. If you've ever used services like ChatGPT, language translators, or voice assistants, you've likely encountered systems that utilize embeddings.

An embedding is a compact representation of raw data, such as images or text, converted into vectors composed of floating-point numbers. This method effectively captures the underlying meaning of the data. By mapping high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space (similar to a form of “lossy compression”), embeddings preserve essential structural or semantic relationships within the data. This process not only reduces the computational load of handling large datasets but also reveals patterns and relationships that might not be obvious in the original data.

Embedding models position semantically similar items close together in the vector space. This means that items with greater similarity are placed nearer to each other. This property enables computers to search for, recommend, and cluster similar items with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

## Are *vectors* and *embeddings* the same?
Although the terms are often used interchangeably to describe numerical data representations where data points are represented as vectors in high-dimensional space, they are not quite the same. Vectors are simply arrays of numbers, with each number corresponding to a specific dimension or feature. In contrast, embeddings utilize vectors to represent data in a structured and meaningful way within continuous space.

While embeddings can indeed be represented as vectors, not all vectors qualify as embeddings. Embeddings generate vectors, but vectors can also be produced through other methods.

Types of Vector Embeddings
There are various kinds of vector embeddings, each designed to represent different types of data:

Word Embeddings: These are the most common embeddings in NLP, capturing semantic relationships between words such as antonyms and synonyms, as well as their contextual usage. They are used in tasks like language translation, word similarity, synonym generation, and sentiment analysis. They also enhance the relevance of search results by understanding the meaning of queries.

Sentence Embeddings: These represent the semantic meaning and context of sentences. They are useful for information retrieval, text categorization, and sentiment analysis. Sentence embeddings help chatbots understand and respond to user inputs more effectively, and they ensure that machine translation services retain the context and meaning of the original sentences.

Document Embeddings: Similar to sentence embeddings, these represent the content and general meaning of entire documents, such as reports or articles. They are employed in recommendation systems, information retrieval, clustering, and document similarity and classification.

Graph Embeddings: These represent edges and nodes of graphs within a vector space. They are used for tasks like node classification, community detection, and link prediction.

Image Embeddings: These capture different aspects of visual items, from individual pixels to entire images. They are used in content-based recommendation systems, image and object recognition, and image search systems by classifying image features.

Product Embeddings: These range from embeddings for digital products like songs and movies to physical products like shampoos and phones. They are valuable for product recommendation based on semantic similarity, classification systems, and product searches.

Audio Embeddings: These represent various features of audio signals, such as rhythm, tone, and pitch, in a vector format. They are used for applications like emotion detection, voice recognition, and music recommendations based on the user’s listening history. They are also essential for developing smart assistants that understand voice commands.

What Types of Objects Can Be Embedded?
Various data types and objects can be represented as vector embeddings. Here are some common examples:

Text: Embeddings can be created for documents, paragraphs, sentences, and words using techniques like Word2Vec (for word embeddings) and Doc2Vec (for document embeddings).

Images: Images are converted into vectors using methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or pre-trained models like ResNet and VGG. These embeddings are widely used in e-commerce applications.

Audio: Audio signals, such as music or speech, can be embedded into numerical representations using techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or spectrogram embeddings. This captures auditory properties, making audio interpretation more effective. Common applications include OpenAI Whisper and Google Speech-to-Text.

Graphs: Nodes and edges in a graph can be embedded using techniques like graph convolutional networks and node embeddings. This captures relational and structural information, where nodes represent entities (e.g., person, product, or web page) and edges represent connections or links between them.

3D Models and Time-Series Data: These embeddings capture temporal patterns in sequential data, useful for sensor data, financial data, and IoT applications. They are employed for pattern identification, anomaly detection, and time-series forecasting. Additionally, 3D model embeddings represent geometric aspects of 3-dimensional objects, used for tasks like form matching, object detection, and 3D reconstruction.

Molecules: Molecule embeddings represent chemical compounds and are used for molecular property prediction, drug discovery and development, and chemical similarity searching.

How Do Neural Networks Create Embeddings?
Neural networks, including large language models such as GPT-4, Llama-2, and Mistral-7B, generate embeddings through a process known as representation learning. In this process, the network learns to map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving the critical properties of the data. They take raw input data, such as images and text, and convert them into numerical vectors.

During training, the neural network learns to transform these representations into meaningful embeddings. This is typically accomplished through layers of neurons—such as recurrent layers and convolutional layers—that adjust their weights and biases based on the training data.

Neural networks often incorporate embedding layers within their architecture. These layers receive processed data from preceding layers and consist of a set number of neurons that define the dimensionality of the embedding space. Initially, the weights in the embedding layer are randomly initialized and updated through techniques like backpropagation. These weights serve as the embeddings themselves, evolving during training to encode meaningful relationships between input data points. As the network continues to learn, these embeddings become increasingly refined representations of data.

Through iterative training, the neural network adjusts its parameters, including the weights in the embedding layer, to better represent the meaning of specific inputs and their relationships to other inputs (e.g., how one word relates to another). Backpropagation is used to adjust these weights and other parameters depending on the overall task, such as image classification, language translation, or another objective.

The training task plays a crucial role in shaping the learned embeddings. By optimizing the network for the specific task at hand, the model learns embeddings that capture the underlying semantic relationships within the input data.

Let's take an example to understand this better. Imagine you're building a neural network for text classification that determines whether a movie review is positive or negative. Here's how it works:

Initially, each word in the vocabulary is randomly assigned an embedding vector that numerically represents the essence of the word. For instance, the vector for the word "good" might be [0.2, 0.5, -0.1], while the vector for the word "bad" might be [0.4, -0.3, 0.6].

The network is then trained on a dataset of labeled movie reviews. During this process, it learns to predict the sentiment of the review based on the words used in it. This involves adjusting the weights, including the embedding vectors, to minimize errors in sentiment prediction.

As the network continues to learn from the data, the embedding vectors for words are fine-tuned to better perform sentiment classification. Words that often appear together in similar contexts, like "good" and "excellent," end up with similar embeddings. Conversely, words with opposite meanings, like "terrible" and "great," have embeddings that are farther apart, reflecting their semantic relationships.

How Do Vector Embeddings Work?
Vector embeddings operate by representing features or objects as points in a multidimensional vector space. The relative positions of these points indicate meaningful relationships between the features or objects, capturing semantic relationships by placing similar items closer together.

Distances between vectors quantify these relationships. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and Manhattan distance, which measure how "close" or "far" vectors are from each other in the multidimensional space.

Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between points.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, often used to determine how similar two vectors are, regardless of their magnitudes. A higher cosine similarity value indicates greater similarity.

Imagine a word embedding space where words are represented as vectors in a two-dimensional space. In this space:

The word "cat" might be represented as [1.2, 0.8].

The word "dog" might be represented as [1.0, 0.9].

The word "car" might be represented as [0.3, -1.5].

In this example, the Euclidean distance between "cat" and "dog" is shorter than the distance between "cat" and "car," indicating that "cat" is more similar to "dog" than to "car." Similarly, the cosine similarity between "cat" and "dog" is higher than that between "cat" and "car," further highlighting their semantic similarity.


How to Create Vector Embeddings for Your Data
Creating vector embeddings of your data is also commonly called vectorization. Here’s a general overview of the vectorization process:

The first step is to collect the raw data that you want to process. This could be text, audio, images, time series data, or any other kind of structured or unstructured data. 
Then, you need to preprocess the data to clean it and make it suitable for analysis. Depending on the kind of data you have, this may involve tasks like tokenization (in the case of text data), removing noise, resizing images, normalization, scaling, and other data cleaning operations.
Next, you need to break down the data into chunks. Depending on the type of data you’re dealing with, you might have to split text into sentences or words (if you have text data), divide images into segments or patches (if you have image data), or partition time series into intervals or windows (if you have time series data).  
Once you preprocess the data and break it into suitable chunks, the next step is to convert each chunk into a vector representation, a process known as embedding. 

## Text to Vectors

The line `inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)` performs several important tasks in the process of converting your text into a format that the model can understand and work with. Let's break it down:

### Tokenization
+ Tokenization:
The tokenizer splits your input text into smaller units called tokens. For example, the sentence "Hugging Face provides state-of-the-art NLP models." might be split into tokens like ['Hugging', 'Face', 'provides', 'state', '-', 'of', '-', 'the', '-', 'art', 'NLP', 'models', '.'].
These tokens are then converted into corresponding numeric IDs, which are the input to the model. Each token has a unique ID in the tokenizer's vocabulary.

### Padding and Truncation
+ Padding:
The padding=True argument ensures that all input sequences in a batch have the same length. This is done by adding padding tokens to shorter sequences so that they match the length of the longest sequence in the batch.
This is useful for batch processing, where multiple inputs need to be processed together. Without padding, sequences of different lengths would need to be handled individually, reducing efficiency.

+ Truncation:
The truncation=True argument ensures that any input sequences longer than the model's maximum input length are truncated. This prevents errors and ensures that all input sequences fit within the model's expected input size.
For example, if the model's maximum input length is 512 tokens, any input longer than that will be cut off at 512 tokens.

### Tensor Conversion
+ Return Tensors:
The `return_tensors="pt"` argument specifies the format of the returned tensors. "pt" stands for PyTorch, so this argument ensures that the outputs are returned as PyTorch tensors.
Tensors are a data structure used in deep learning to store data and perform operations on it efficiently.

### What is the benefit of *Tokenization* before vectorization
Tokenization plays a crucial role in vectorizing text. It's like breaking down a large block of text into smaller pieces, often referred to as tokens. Here’s a snapshot of the benefits:

+ Simplifies Complex Data:

Original Text: "Tokenization is the process of converting text into tokens."

Tokens: `['Tokenization', 'is', 'the', 'process', 'of', 'converting', 'text', 'into', 'tokens']`

By breaking down the sentence into individual tokens, each word can be analyzed separately.

+ Maintains Context:

Original Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

Tokens: `['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']`

Each token retains its position and meaning in the sentence, preserving the context for further processing.

+ Reduces Noise:

Original Text: "Hello!!! How are you???"

Tokens: `['Hello', 'How', 'are', 'you']`

Tokenization removes unnecessary punctuation, reducing noise in the text.

+ Enables Numerical Representation:

Tokens: `['Tokenization', 'is', 'the', 'process', 'of', 'converting', 'text', 'into', 'tokens']`

Vector Representation: `[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] (For example, using one-hot encoding)`

Each token is converted into a numerical vector that can be used in machine learning models.

+ Handles Different Languages and Formats:
    + English Text: "Tokenization is essential."
    + French Text: "La tokenisation est essentielle."
    + Tokens (English): ['Tokenization', 'is', 'essential']
    + Tokens (French): ['La', 'tokenisation', 'est', 'essentielle']

Tokenization can handle multiple languages, converting text into tokens for each language.
By applying tokenization, you can transform text into manageable pieces that retain meaning and context while making it easier for machines to process and analyze.

## Image to Vectors

Model:
The model in the script is the CLIPModel from Hugging Face. It serves several purposes:

Pre-trained Embeddings: The model is pre-trained on a large dataset, which enables it to generate meaningful embeddings (vectors) for images and text.

Feature Extraction: It processes the input image and extracts high-dimensional features that represent the content of the image. These features capture the essential visual information needed for various machine learning tasks.

Transfer Learning: Leveraging a pre-trained model like CLIP allows you to benefit from transfer learning, where the knowledge gained from training on a large dataset is applied to your specific task.

Processor:
The processor in the script is the CLIPProcessor from Hugging Face. It handles the following tasks:

Preprocessing: The processor prepares the input image for the model. This includes resizing, normalizing, and converting the image into the format expected by the model.

Tokenization: For text inputs, the processor would also handle tokenization, converting text into tokens that the model can understand. In this case, it's used solely for images.

Returning Tensors: The processor converts the preprocessed image into tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) that can be fed into the model for further processing.

Workflow:
Processor Preprocesses the Image: The image is loaded and preprocessed by the processor, which ensures it matches the input requirements of the model.

Model Extracts Features: The preprocessed image is then passed to the model, which extracts the image features and converts them into a vector.

In summary, the processor prepares the input data, ensuring it's in the correct format for the model, while the model performs the heavy lifting of extracting meaningful features from the image.


## Audio to Vectors

Model:
The model used in the script is the Wav2Vec2Model from Hugging Face. Its roles include:

Pre-trained Embeddings: The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of audio recordings. This enables it to generate meaningful embeddings (vectors) for audio data.

Feature Extraction: It processes the input audio and extracts high-dimensional features that represent the content of the audio. These features capture the essential information needed for various machine learning tasks, such as speech recognition or audio classification.

Transfer Learning: Leveraging a pre-trained model like Wav2Vec2 allows you to benefit from transfer learning, where the knowledge gained from training on a large dataset is applied to your specific task.

Processor:
The processor used in the script is the Wav2Vec2Processor from Hugging Face. Its roles include:

Preprocessing: The processor prepares the input audio for the model. This includes tasks such as resampling, normalizing, and padding the audio data to match the input requirements of the model.

Tokenization: For text inputs, the processor handles tokenization, converting text into tokens that the model can understand. In this case, it's used solely for audio data.

Returning Tensors: The processor converts the preprocessed audio data into tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) that can be fed into the model for further processing.

Workflow:
Processor Preprocesses the Audio: The audio file is loaded and preprocessed by the processor, which ensures it matches the input requirements of the model.

Model Extracts Features: The preprocessed audio is then passed to the model, which extracts the audio features and converts them into a vector.

In summary, the processor prepares the input data, ensuring it's in the correct format for the model, while the model performs the heavy lifting of extracting meaningful features from the audio.

Resampling:
Resampling refers to changing the sample rate of an audio signal. The sample rate is the number of samples (data points) captured per second. Common sample rates include 44.1 kHz (used for CDs) and 48 kHz (used for professional audio).

In the context of the script:

The pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model expects audio input at a sample rate of 16 kHz (16,000 samples per second).

If your audio file has a different sample rate, resampling adjusts the audio to match the model's expected input. For example, if your audio file is at 44.1 kHz, resampling converts it to 16 kHz.

This ensures that the audio data is compatible with the model and can be processed correctly.

Normalizing:
Normalizing adjusts the amplitude (volume) of the audio signal to a standard level. This process ensures that the audio data is consistently scaled, which helps improve the performance of the model.

In the context of the script:

Normalization typically involves scaling the audio waveform so that the amplitude values fall within a specific range (e.g., -1 to 1).

This process ensures that the audio data is neither too quiet nor too loud, which can affect the model's ability to accurately extract features.

Normalization helps to reduce variability in the input data, making it easier for the model to learn and generalize from the audio.

By resampling and normalizing the audio, the processor ensures that the audio data is in the correct format and scale for the model, allowing it to extract meaningful features effectively.
